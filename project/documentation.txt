canvas-style drawing tool which supports multiple users with individual dashboards and saved work

1) start page
- sign up button: creates a user with a password and stores it in local memory
- log in button: opens the login prompt
-log in prompt: takes a user and password input and checks for user matches in the memory, then checks the password
    if the user exists and has inputted the correct password, the prompt displays "Welcome back!" and creates a variable to account for the current user 
-start button: immediately opens a new empty canvas named "Canvas 1".
- dashboard button: opens the user's dashboard

2) notebook page: the main page where users can modify canvases
- toolbar: has html inputs to select color and size of the brush
           a circular button with the initial of the user that redirects to dashboard (hints this upon hover as well)
           initially this button displays ? if no user is logged in yet
           a textbox that contains the name of the canvas (can be edited by user)
           the name of the first canvas is Canvas 1 by default. The name of any subsequently created canvas is "Canvas X"
           where X is the first number starting from 1 for which "Canvas X" does not appear yet in the user's saved files
            adjusts with display resizing
            clear and undo button (self explainatory)
            save button (saves current canvas). if this is a new canvas it appends it to the list, if this is a canvas ever saved before, it just replaces
- the canvas itself:
    the user can see and scroll through a canvas that is initially 3000 by 2000 pixels. (the displayed window can be smaller depending on the monitor)
    the canvas expands horizontally when scrolling down towards the bottom of the already generated canvas.

3) dashboard
- a log out button that also redirects to start page
- the main part of the page displays the array of saved canvases along with their names (for current user), 
    that also adjusts dinamically with display resizing
    clicking on a canvas will open it in a notebook
    the first "dummy canvas" is an option to create a new canvas

*) any time you want to save or open the dashboard while you are not logged in, the log in prompt pops up asking you for username and password
